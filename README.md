easyrunner
==========

This will eventually be a helper script to easily run targeted tests (unit, integration, ui, what have you).

It's intended to be helpful when whatever test runner you're using doesn't offer sufficient test-filtering options, and/or when you need to run time-consuming test suites and would like to have progressive test tallies printed to the terminal as the suite runs.

Right now it's only partially functional. I wouldn't bother at this point if I were you, but if you're interested, let me know!
